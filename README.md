# Maximize-WordPacking

The aim is to fit as many words as we can into one "bin" from a list of 5757 words in sgb-words.txt

The rule is that, no 2 words in the same bin can have the same character in the same position.
e.g "hahah" would conflict with "balet" because of the 'a' in the second position.
